### Challenge #1

The challenge was interesting and I enjoyed it a lot.<br />
I went through a lot of brainstorming as you can see.

For the solution I used Java 8.<br />
For sorting the input list I used Quick sort executed in separate methods, <br />
I created a simple entity to construct my pairs and everything else is the pairing algorithm. <br />
The algorithm itself iterates through the list once which makes it with time complexity of O(n) 
and the sorting algorithm is additional O(n log n) on average.
